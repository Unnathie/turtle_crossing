# 🐢 Turtle Crossing: The Color Chaos Edition

Ever wondered what it’s like to be a fearless turtle trying to cross a highway full of… **tiny rainbow bricks**?  
Well, wonder no more — this game is here to answer a question nobody asked.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Run the game** in Python (instructions below).  
2. Use the **↑ Arrow Key** to move your turtle forward.  
3. Dodge the colorful “cars” (yes, we’re calling them cars).  
4. Reach the top to level up — but beware, each level gets *faster*.  
5. Get hit and it’s **💀 GAME OVER 💀**.

## ✨ Features
- Randomly colored, block-shaped cars for maximum chaos.
- Smooth level progression with increasing speed.
- Simple controls — even your pet goldfish could play (but please don’t).
